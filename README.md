This repository contains my AP Computer Science Principles Project (2024), where I designed a Patient System Tracker using Python and PyQt5 for UI. The project revolves around admitting patients into hospital systems such that users can input, store, and manage patient information efficiently.

Project Overview
The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) upon which users can:
- Register new patients by inputting information such as name, date of birth, gender, height, weight, symptoms, and purpose of visit.
- Manage patient records, i.e., the ability to add, remove, and show stored patient information.
- Employ text-to-speech (TTS) capability with gTTS and Pygame to read out patient details for accessibility.
- Utilize QTDesigner for elements' placing.
